IMAGE SEGMENTATION
Image segmentation is a fundamental process in image processing, involving the partitioning of an image into multiple segments to simplify or change its representation for easier analysis. This technique is widely applied in various domains, including medical imaging, computer vision, and pattern recognition. The process of image segmentation has been the subject of extensive research, leading to the development of diverse techniques and algorithms to address its challenges. Kidney segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, particularly in the fields of radiology and medical imaging. Accurate segmentation of kidneys is essential for various applications, such as disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of kidney-related disorders. This paper focuses on performing manual segmentation of the kidneys using Mimics; performing automatic segmentation using traditional image processing with OPENCV; and performing automatic segmentation using Deep learning method.
